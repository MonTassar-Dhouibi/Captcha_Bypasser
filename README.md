__HRShell__ is an HTTPS/HTTP reverse shell built with flask and is compatible with __python 3.x__. The `client.py` has been successfully tested on:
*   ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-white.svg??style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&linux&logoColor=black) Linux ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Kali Linux 2019.3
*   ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-white.svg??style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&windows&logoColor=black) macOS Mojave/Catalina
*   ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-white.svg??style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&windows&logoColor=black) Windows 7/10

while the `server.py` is compatible with Unix systems (_Windows support comming soon..._)

### Features

*   It's stealthy
*   __TLS__ support üîë
    -   Either using _on-the-fly_ certificates or
    -   By specifying a cert/key pair (_more details below..._)
*   Shellcode injection üíâ (_more details below..._)
    -   Either shellcode injection in a thread/spawned-process of the current running process
        *   Platforms supported so far: 
            *   __Windows x86__   
            *   __Unix x86__
            *   __Unix x64__
    -   or shellcode injection into another process (`migrate <PID>`) by specifying its PID
        *   Platforms supported so far: 
            *   __Windows x86__
            *   __Windows x64__
*   Shellcode can be set/modified on the fly from the server (_more details below..._)   
*   Proxy support on client.
*   Directory navigation (`cd` command and variants).
*   Interactive `history` command available on Unix systems.
*   `download/upload/screenshot/hex` commands available.
*   Pipelining (`|`) & chained commands (`;`) are supported
*   Support for every non-interactive (_like gdb, top etc..._) command
*   Server is both HTTP & HTTPS capable.
*   It comes with two built-in servers üåê so far... _flask built-in_ & _tornado-WSGI_ while it's also compatible with other production servers like [`gunicorn`](http://gunicorn.org/) and [`Nginx`](https://www.nginx.com/).
*   Both `server.py` and `client.py` are easily extensible.
*   Since the most functionality comes from server's endpoint-design it's very easy to write a client in any other language _e.g. java, GO etc..._

### Details

### Stealthy :shipit:
HRShell is stealthy since it uses the HTTP(S) protocol as the communication method between client and server. In addition when TLS is in use the traffic is also encrypted. Also if the CERT is not hand coded on client-side (_which is a feasible option_) and the `upload` command is not used, then `client.py` doesn't touches the disk at all.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è That the SSL verification is disabled by default on client **doesn't** mean in any case that the TLS is disabled too, **TLS will be enabled** if the server uses it - so **TLS depends completely on the server**. The `--cert` option _on client_ is there just as an alternative way for the server-client to have an encrypted session and that's all. 

### Shellcode injection üíâ

There are two "modes" of shellcode injection using the two following commands respectively:

1. `migrate <PID>`: Using this command we can inject shellcode into the memory space of another process by specifying its PID. For now this command can only be applied at __Windows x86/x64__ platforms!

<img src="images/1.png">

2. `inject shellcode`: Using this command a new thread (_or spawned process on unix systems_) of our current process is created and the shellcode injection occurs in its memory space. As a result our HTTP(S) shell is not affected by the injection. The platforms where this command can be applied are: __Unix x86/x64, Windows x86__ platforms!

<img src="images/2.png">

##### Notes

*   In case the injection happens on a process, then process-permissions play a very important role. It's not always possible to inject on any process due to lack of appropriate privileges.



<img src="images/3.png" width="60%">

The first way is pretty straight forward. However in order to use the second and more convenient way (_since you can also modify an already specified shellcode_) you have to set `shellcodes/utils.py` script such that it contains the shellcode(s) of your choise. The script contains an example of how you can do that.

> üí° You can modify/update `shellcodes/utils.py` script even after you've launched `server.py` as many times as you want, since `server.py` will dynamically use the most updated/recent version. In this way you can set & modify shellcodes on the go...

### Available commands:

Special commands:

<img src="images/4.png" width="70%">

__Server-side:__

If the command demands the existence of a new-endpoint on server-side, then:
*   to define the endpoint:
    ```python
    @app.route('/custom_endpoint/<arg>')
    def custom_endpoint(arg):
        """
        documentation if needed
        """
        ...
        return ...
    ```
*   then edit `handleGET()` to redirect the client to that endpoint:
    ```python
    @app.route('/')
    def handleGET():
        ...
        return redirect(url_for('custom_endpoint',
            arg=...)
            )
    ```
*   do the appropriate edits in `handlePOST()` to handle the presentation of the results.

#### Script-Arguments

Both scripts (_server.py_ and _client.py_) can be customized through arguments:

__server.py__
```
$ python server.py -h
usage: server.py [-h] [-s] [-c] [--host] [-p] [--http] [--cert] [--key]

server.py: An HTTP(S) reverse-shell server with advanced features.

arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -s , --server   Specify the HTTP(S) server to use (default: flask).
  -c , --client   Accept connections only from the specified client/IP.
  --host          Specify the IP to use (default: 0.0.0.0).
  -p , --port     Specify a port to use (default: 5000).
  --http          Disable TLS and use HTTP instead.
  --cert          Specify a certificate to use (default: None).
  --key           Specify the corresponding private key to use (default: None).
```
